You must have this number as proof of payment in order to schedule your visa interview appointment. It is the applicant’s responsibility to save this number. If not, you may not be able to schedule an interview with your payment.

Applicants with a mobile phone can pay their MRV Fee via their phone using the IMPs system, however, the applicant must be preregistered with their bank to complete payment via their mobile phone and be in possession of a valid MPIN.

Payment of Visa fees shall be in Indian Rupees (INR) and must be the exact amount as listed on the payment confirmation screen available after logging into your profile

Applicants can initiate an IMPS payment via SMS to their bank or via the m-banking facility provided by their financial institution.

Applicants must enter the correct Beneficiary Mobile Number, Beneficiary MMID number and correct amounts.

Please note, many banks operate a payment limit of INR 5,000/- per transaction. To see a list of daily limits employed by India banks, please click here:

Once the payment has been verified, you will receive a SMS containing the 12 digit IMPS reference number. Applicants must then enter the IMPS reference number after logging into their profile. Once verified, the applicant will be able to proceed to the appointment scheduling stage.

            Crew members who will be entering the United States during time-off between flights or cruises should also obtain a B-1/B-2 visa to use during these personal/vacation days. Applicants applying simultaneously for both a C-1/D and a B-1/B-2 visa pay only one visa application fee.<br/>
